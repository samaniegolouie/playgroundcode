I haven't supported real estate investors before either-- just marketing and social media needs for real estate agents/ company. Also for the top of my resume I have 12 years of work experience.  I have some business management experience but it's not my strongest suit.--- the skills you mentioned in the first bio ( Amber) you created for me are more along my background experience (unless you are adjusting it specifically for real estate clients) = ALL GOOD",
